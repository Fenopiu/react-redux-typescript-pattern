# React + Redux + TypeScript pattern

This is a pattern for using React with Redux in TypeScript. This includes type-safety for FSA ([Flux standard actions](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action)) at the action creation and in the reducer.

React Components are wrapped in a Container that connects the Component to Redux. Interfaces are declared for the component's Props in the Container; split into `Props` and `Actions` to separate properties and action callbacks.

### Layout

The folder / file layout this pattern uses is:

* `src/modules/index.js` the root file for the Redux store and root reducer
* `src/modules/<module>` app modules, containing components, containers, actions and reducers.
* `src/modules/<module>/components` React components
* `src/modules/<module>/containers` React component containers
* `src/modules/<module>/actions.ts` Redux action creators
* `src/modules/<module>/reducer.ts` Redux reducer

## Dependencies

* [react](http://reactjs.org)
* [redux](https://redux.js.org)
* [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) (connects React and Redux)
* [typescript-fsa](https://github.com/aikoven/typescript-fsa) (type-safe creators for flux standard actions)
* [typescript-fsa-reducers](https://github.com/dphilipson/typescript-fsa-reducers) (type-safe reducers for flux standard actions)
* [redux-devtools-extension](http://extension.remotedev.io) (debug Redux)

## Running

You can run this project by cloning the git repo, then cd into the project folder.

We use yarn instead of npm, so first:

```
npm -g install yarn
```

Then install the required node modules:

```
yarn install
```

Then run it using:

```
yarn start
```

## Setup

This project was setup using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can setup your own project using the commands below.

Install `create-react-app`:

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

Create the project using `create-react-app`:

```
create-react-app <project> --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts
cd <project>
```

Install dependencies:

```
yarn add redux react-redux
yarn add -D @types/react-redux
yarn add typescript-fsa-reducers typescript-fsa
```

Include the devtools:

```
yarn add redux-devtools-extension
```

Copy the template files by copying the `modules` folder from this
repository into your new project:

```
cp -r ../react-redux-typescript-pattern/src/modules src/
```

Then look at the `src/App.tsx` in this pattern to see how to include the example container into your project.

### IDE

Any development environment should suffice. I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Download and install VSCode.

Install extensions by going to the Extensions tab (or selecting Extensions from the View menu).

Install the following extensions:
* TSLint

There is a good tutorial on using [Visual Studio Code with React](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/reactjs-tutorial).

#### Debugging

Create a file `.vscode/launch.json` with the following contents:

```
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "chrome",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Chrome against localhost",
            "url": "http://localhost:3000",
            "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
        }
    ]
}
```

Then after running `yarn start`, close the browser window it creates, then go to the Debug tab in VSCode and click the Play button.

### Redux DevTools Extension

Install the Redux DevTools for Chrome, Firefox and others by visiting http://extension.remotedev.io and following the instructions.
